<div style="float: right: ">2018 06 10</div>

Formír, you see the grass in front of you, and smell the soil. You know that
you are home, but you also know that you are not actually here, that this is a
dream. Dream of neckles and sister. 
Wake in bed, in the second floor room of the shop where you took a job protect—
ing the shop of an old man. You get up, and go down stairs.
Neckless I will steal
Bird sees me
I see ben in the garden
Ancient shop keep

Whispers
Formír leans in... "Run a...way..."

##[12 hours earlier]

Stand in front of the shop, The Black Urn, an ancient temple converted to shop.
It is hot, evening. The day has begun to take on that golden hue of evening.
Everything is thick and broad. And it is a good thing, because it is warn away.

The warm wind blows the dusty road 

Light filters in 
Boumd with iron cords
Wide on top, and narrow then wide on the bottom

A sound like a scream and a screach of a bird comes from inside. Rothgar and
Formír rush in to find a shop set up in an ancient temple.
An old man was sleeping. A black clad figure seems to have fumbled and blown
his cover. The figure draws its sword, seeming ready to kill the old man.
Rothgar throws his knife, barely missing.
Formír rushes in to stop the figure. The old man wakes. Formír asks what is going on. The old man calls theif.
Formír warns the figure to drop the sword. The figure fights.
Formír tells the figure to drop the sword. They trade blows. Eventually Formír
sweeps the figures legs, and Rothgar cuts off the figures arm. A woman (proabably a grand daughter) cowers.
After the figure dies the girl stabs the body with its own sword.

The old man asks that the gaurd not be called.

Story of th eurn

The blue emporer was held prisoner in his palace by a demon disguised as his
favorite concubine. The emporors blacksmith saved the emporor by constructing
the urn, and luring the demon in by placing a human heart in hte bottom, and
slamming the lid when the demon went inside.

##[Later — Just before dusk]

"I've lived here since I was a young man. There is nothing in the urn, but lets not open it anyway." He says, smiling and patting Formír's hand.
He picks up a white ivory urn (a small replica of the large urn). He reads, "To look into the face of evil, gaze inside."
In the bottom of the vace is the most spectacular mirror they'd ever seen.
By'hú (the young woman) brings in a tray of tea.

As she set down the tray Rothgar looks at her, and flashes back to he pale face
splattered across it, framed by ebony hair. Rothgar is nearly overwhelmed by a sense of attraction to the young woman.

A discussion, commences about the egg. Upon asking about the egg Ben immediately percieves that they have it, and asks what kind it is. Formír insists they have none. Rothgar heads the conversation. Ben wants to know more.
He has Rothgar retrieve an ancient book from a shelf. (White three tailed fox). See snatched of serpents, worms, and other creatures that might be dragons.

"Where should we begin?"

Formír, 'river dragon'

Rothgar gets up and walks around. He goes to the garden. He finds cat's [something], break of a small piece, crushing it in his hand. The smell reminds him of home.

Formír closes the front door.

He comes back, and tells Ben the story.

He puts 

"Fishpig, go away, leave our guests alone".

They talk some more.




##[Rothgar Dreams — By'Hú]

He is back in the temple, during the fight earlier. He cuts off the mans arm, the girls flies at him. She is led away.
In the blood smeared on the floor he sees the words written "Help me".

### He Wakes

Then he wakes. He sees Formír is gone, and doesn't care.
He leaves his room to see the girl. He goes quietly, by way of the outward facing balcony, and heads to her room.

The ancient temple, turned shop, lay mostly in shadows, interrupted in places by pools of moonlight.

The question is growing in his mind, where is Formír. As Rothgar passes the large central room he sees Formír. A breeze catches the curtain, drawing Rothgar's eye to where By'Hú lay sleeping, her ebony lay about her.

Rothgar had set a boundary for himself, a boundary he would not allow himself to cross. It was a limit between his life, and the life he would pursue were he to pass through the door and enter the room.
Rothgar reached back to keep the tip of his sword, and with his other hand pounds the banister.

The bird screaches. Formír begins to run when he sees a Crow kneeling on the Urn. Three more land around the Urn.

...
...
Rothgar shoots one on the Urn in the back.

"What are you doing?" No response.

Formír runs to attack

One climbs the balcony, and Rothgar cuts his head off.

Formír kills the one who was shot.

Two jump off the urn and attack Formír. Formír blocks one, saving himself from decapitation

Rothgar jumps from the balcony.

One who jumped down attacks Formír, barely missing.

Formír impales him with his axe...

Rothgar cuts another in half, and deflects a return blow.

Rothgar circles the urn to attack another.

Formír demands a response. None is given.

Formír notices a box, grabs it, and barely avoids having his head cut off by one still alive on the top of the urn, but is knocked to the floor.

One of the Crow jump on Formír, and stabs him. Formír grabs the guy, and bites his throat.
